# learn-full-stack-game
A step by step, test driven learning experience for aspiring full-stack web developers

Welcome future web develooper! Today you will be building the game asteroid from scratch using:
	JQuery for writing client side code,
	Node.js for server side code,
	SQL to create a database to save high scores.

Step One:
	Fork this repository by clicking the "fork" button in the top left corner of the screen and select your respitory as the destination. Now you will have a copy of the of the project files on your github account.To download these files from your Github account to your desktop, copy the URL on the right hand side. Then, open your terminal and type:

	 git clone *paste the url here*

Step Two:
	navigate to the folder and type the following commands:

	 npm install
	 bower install

in that order. This will ensure that all of the files you will need for this project are downloaded and ready to go. 

Building a server:
	Open your browser and type:

	http://localhost:8000

what do you see? You should see nothing and that is because your server isn't set up to send the necessary pages to your broswer. We are going to set up a server today using Javascript and more specifically Node.js. Javascript was designed to only run in browsers. If you tried running your javascript code in your terminal, nothing will happen. Node was created to allow you to run javascript anywhere you want.

Node has serveral packages that you will need to add to your project uing the 'require' statement.
